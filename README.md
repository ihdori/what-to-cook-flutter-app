## Overview

What to Cook is an application designed to assist mothers in reducing the confusion of meal planning. By allowing users to select meal times (breakfast, lunch, or dinner) and the origin of the food (Iraqi or global), the app provides tailored food suggestions that meet their specifications. Additionally, each food suggestion includes a link to a YouTube tutorial for preparation.
